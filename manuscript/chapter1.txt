# How I will do this project


[ TODO ]


## The three phases

[ TODO ]


## Phase One

- Create a raw data file

    ... perhaps in a google drive spreadsheet that can be exported as a .csv file, for the past 10 years of Eurovision winners. Do some copy/paste manually from sites such as Wikipedia, if I am not able to find some database with this already. Don't try to make a data scraper or automate this, at this stage
store this in source control, eg github


- Install elastic locally on my computer

    ...at home, and on my laptop, depending on where I am working from. Do not try to create a docker image or store this in source control at this point

## Phase Two

- Import this data file to Kibana
 
- Create some visualisations

- I will probably want to do some data enhancements at this point, such as adding more data, or converting the .csv to SQL or a more viable database solution

## Phase Three

- Dockerise the whole project

    ...using inspiration from https://github.com/htmevik/elastic-gcdit which was a great initiative and probably the most fun workshop I have attended. Thank you Girls Can Do IT, Oslo!

    ...in order to have a package that can be stored in the cloud, and thus used and run by anyone.

## Will blog, write book, and do at the same time

I will probably change things as I go, based on your feedback, my learnings, and anything else that pops up.  However the overall goal will remain the same: make fab dashboards of Eurovision data, using Kibana, in a simple and timely manner, while having fun!
