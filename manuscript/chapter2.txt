# Getting started with Phase One


In this chapter you will follow along with how I create the data file, and then install Elastic on my computer.

These are the minimum pre-requisites for having an environment to start using Elastic.

In other words, in order to make data dashboards, you need data, and some software that will make the dashboard.  You will learn how I do that in this chapter.


## Create a raw data file

[ WORK IN PROGRESS ]

For this I went to https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_winners and found a table with all the winners within seconds. Great!

It also has more data that I initially care about, such as how many points they won by, and who the runner up was for that year. I will ignore the tempation to add this data for now, to avoid digressing from my initial goal.

I then went to github, logged in with my existing account, and created a repo https://github.com/purplebugs/fantasticelastic/

If you have never used github before, don’t worry. Just create an account, and then create a repo.  While creating a repo it will ask about adding a ReadMe file and ask you to select your licence. It is good practise to do both, though don’t worry if you leave them blank or select the wrong licence for now.

In my case I selected the MIT licence, and created a Readme. If you want to copy the format of my readme, go to ... click Edit... and copy the formatting to get headings, links etc in preview mode. Don‘t worry about details for now, just keep on moving forward.

After creating my repo, readme and selecting a license, I then added a file to my repo called EurovisionWinners.csv and starting manually typing out the following in from Wikipedia:

...... start snip ......
year, country, song, performer, language
2019, Netherlands, Arcade, Duncan Laurence, English
2018, 

..... end snip .....

I completed the list so the last ten years of winners were in it, saved the file and added a comment to my commit.  This took me a few minutes.  Great!


START TIP.

“Make it work, then make it right”

What I mean by this is I want to keep the database simple for now, because my initial goal is to get to the point where I can create a Kibana dashboard with something that is “good enough”.

It is way to easy to get sidetracked and hung up on ideas that I know would be cool to have, although I know from experience it is important to get to the initial goal quickly, then refine. “Make it work, make it right” is a tip one of my mentors has said to me time and again, and it has saved me often enough from imminent time wastage... but I digress...


END TIP.
