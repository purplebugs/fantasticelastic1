# What's Next?


I want the world to see these gorgeous dashboards and charts.

Product managers all over the world have development teams that use elastic to incorporate charts, graphs and dashboards into their software and applications.

So now it's my turn to pop on my product manager hat, have a little brainstorming session withe myself and decide how to share this info.

## Creating a demo with the dashboard

A great way to enhance a sales pitch for products that the company envisions however has not quite completed (and we are pretty much there all the time in software development, right?) is to wow them with data that the potential customer can easily digest.


In the same way, I am going to try to wow you, dear reader, with a demo of this awesome Eurovision data nerd fan dashboard, which is not yet a software product, just some cool charts and bells and whistles.
